# AI-Driven End-to-End Data Science Platform with Automated Model Deployment and Continuous Monitoring

# Scalable Data Science Platform with Flyte

## Overview

This project builds a comprehensive, scalable data science platform that leverages **Flyte** to orchestrate the entire machine learning lifecycle. The platform automates various stages, including data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, deployment, monitoring, and auto-retraining, creating a robust and fully automated end-to-end pipeline. 

By using Flyte for orchestration, this project demonstrates advanced MLOps practices and automation, integrating AI-powered decision-making to adapt to new data and adjust the system’s behavior over time.

## Key Features

- **Automated Data Pipeline Orchestration:** Automates data ingestion, preprocessing, and data splitting for training, validation, and testing.
- **AI-Powered Model Selection & Hyperparameter Tuning:** Automatically selects the best model and fine-tunes hyperparameters using Bayesian Optimization.
- **End-to-End Model Deployment:** Automates model deployment with continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
- **Auto-Scaling Model Serving:** Scales the model serving infrastructure based on traffic load using Kubernetes.
- **Continuous Model Monitoring & Retraining:** Monitors model performance and triggers auto-retraining when performance drops.
- **Real-Time Data Feedback Loop:** Automatically collects new data for continual learning and model refinement.
- **Visualization Dashboard & Reporting:** Real-time monitoring with dashboards for model performance, data processing metrics, and deployment health.
- **Serverless Infrastructure:** Uses Flyte’s serverless capabilities to optimize resource usage.

## Technologies Used

- **Flyte:** Workflow orchestration platform for managing and automating the entire ML lifecycle.
- **Python:** Primary language for data processing, machine learning, and APIs.
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, PyTorch.
- **Cloud:** AWS, GCP for infrastructure and model deployment.
- **Kubernetes:** Container orchestration for scalable model serving.
- **Docker:** Containerization of model and pipeline environments.
- **Grafana/Tableau:** Visualization and monitoring.
- **GitHub Actions:** CI/CD pipelines for continuous deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Flyte Installation:** 
   - Install Flyte on your local machine or cloud environment using Flyte’s documentation.
   - Install Flyte CLI: `pip install flytekit`
   - Install Flyte sandbox for local development (optional): `flytekit-sandbox`

2. **Cloud Configuration:**
   - Set up AWS/GCP credentials for cloud-based deployment.

3. **Docker:** 
   - Ensure Docker is installed and configured to containerize the models and pipelines.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/10sharmashivam/Automated_model_deployment_flyte.git
   cd FlyteMLOpsPipelineDesign

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3.	Set up your Flyte environment by configuring Flyte with cloud credentials:

    ```bash
    flyte-cli register --project <your-flyte-project> --domain <your-flyte-domain>

### Running the Project

1.	Data Pipeline Workflow:
Run the Flyte workflows for data ingestion and preprocessing:

    ```bash
    flyte-cli run workflow data_ingestion
    flyte-cli run workflow data_preprocessing
    ```

2.	Model Training and Deployment:
Execute the model training and deployment workflows:

    ```bash
    flyte-cli run workflow model_training
    flyte-cli run workflow model_deployment
    
3.	Model Monitoring and Retraining:
Start monitoring the deployed model and trigger retraining if necessary:

    ```bash
    flyte-cli run workflow performance_monitoring
    flyte-cli run workflow model_retraining

4.	Auto-scaling:
Kubernetes will automatically scale the model serving based on the load, as configured in the auto_scaling.py workflow.
